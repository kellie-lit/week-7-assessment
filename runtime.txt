Overall: 

The amount starts off faster than the append function. While this happened  it stays relatively fast and small as it scales up.

By using the .push is faster to increase exponentially, while append stays relatively fast and small as it scales up for the extraLargeArray, LargeArray, and mediumArray. 

.unshift adds the first item to position 0 which is faster for the smallArray, and .unshift is faster for the tinyArray
